## Introduction to Data

The upcoming weeks will be focused on using R for data cleaning and analysis. Let's first get on the same page with some terms:

* A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.

* An **observation** is a set of measurements for the same unit. An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. I’ll sometimes refer to an observation as a **data point** or an **element**.

* A **value** is the state of a variable for a particular observation. 

* **Tabular data** is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data has rows (observations)  and columns (variables). Also called **rectangular** data or **spreadsheets**.

### Where's my data?

To start, you first need to know where your data lives. Sometimes, the data is stored as a file on your computer, e.g. csv, Excel, SPSS, or some other file type. When the data is on your computer, we say the data is stored **locally**.

Data can also be stored externally on the Internet, in a package, or obtained through other sources. For example, some R packages contain datasets. The `nycflights13` package contains information on flights that departed NYC in 2013.

```{r message=FALSE}
# not run
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
names(flights)
rm(flights)
# 
```

Later in this course, we'll discuss how to obtain data from web APIs and websites. For now, the rest of the unit discusses data that is stored **locally**.

### Data Storage

Ideally, your data should be stored in a certain file format. I recommend a `csv` (comma separated value) file, which formats spreadsheet (rectangular) data in a plain-text format. `csv` files are plain-text, and can be read into almost any statistical software program, including R. Try to avoid Excel files if you can. 

Here are some other tips:

* When working with spreadsheets, the first row is usually reserved for the header, while the first column is used to identify the sampling unit (**unique identifier**, or **key**.)
* Avoid file names and variable names with blank spaces. This can cause errors when reading in data.
* If you want to concatenate words, insert a `.` or `_` in between to words instead of a space;
* Short names are prefered over longer names;
* Try to avoid using names that contain symbols such as `?`, `$`,`%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `-`, `#`, `?`, `,`, `<`, `>`, `/`, `|`, `\`, `[` ,`]`,`{`, and `}`;
* make sure that any missing values in your data set are indicated with `NA` or blank fields (don't use 99 or 77)..
