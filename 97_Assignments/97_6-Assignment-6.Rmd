## Assignment 6 Solutions

- __Assigned__: Nov 12, 2019
- __Due__: Nov 21, 2019 at 12:29pm.

In this unit, we'll use R to turn a bunch of loose text documents into a real-life database. (Note: This database was created for a project by R. Terman and E. Voeten, and was processed using much the same process as you'll be learning here.)

The problem set will leverage your new R skills, especially working with strings; writing functions; using iteration; and thinking like a programmer.

**Important**: The code has been scaffolded for you, meaning that you have to fill in the blanks. Once you're ready to submit the assignment, you have to remove the `eval = F` from the R chunk header. If you don't, the chunk won't execute when you knit the Rmarkdown file.

#### About the Data {-}

We'll be creating a database from [Universal Period Review outcome reports](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BasicFacts.aspx).

The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process run by the United Nations Human Rights Council, which involves a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States.

Reviews take place through an interactive discussion between the State under review and other UN Member States. During this discussion any UN Member State can pose questions, comments and/or make recommendations to the States under review. States under review can then respond, stating which recommendations they reject, accept, will consider, etc. Reports are then drawn up detailing this discussion.

We will be analyzing outcome reports from the 2014 Universal Period Reviews of 42 countries, which we retrieved [here](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/Documentation.aspx) and formatted as text documents.

The goal is to convert these semi-structured texts to a tabular dataset of **recommendations** with the following variables:

1. Text of recommendation (*text*)
2. Country to which the recommendation is directed (*to*)
3. Country that is making the recommendation (*from*)
4. The year when the review took place (*year*)
5. The response to the recommendation, i.e. whether the reviewed country rejects, accepts, etc (*decision*)

In other words, we want to turn this:

<img src="img/text.png" width="600">

into this:

<img src="img/tabular.png" width="400">

Take a few minutes to look at the files, which are located in `data/txts`, and get a sense for how they're structured.

Then run the following code to get started.

```{r message = F}
library(readtext)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)

# read all texts
all_texts <- readtext("data/txts/")
```

#### 1. Extract One Document {-}

We're going to start off working with just one document. We'll then use that code to iterate over all the documents.

**task**:

- Extract one document.
- Collect information on the country and year.
- Extract the section we're interested in.
- Turn each line (i.e. recommendation) into an item in a vector.

Let's start off working with `cotedivoire2014.txt` (the third file).

```{r}
text <- all_texts$text[3]
file_name <- all_texts$doc_id[3]
```

__1.1 Assign country and year variables.__

You'll notice that the `file_name` consists of the name of the reviewed country and the year. Slice `file_name` to create 2 new variables, `country`, and `year`.

Be careful! Remember that we are going to apply this to the other file names later. However you slice "cotedivoire2014.txt", it needs to work for the other files in the `data/txts` directory.

```{r}
country <- str_sub(file_name, 1, -9)
year <-str_sub(file_name, -8, -5)
```

__1.2 Get the Recommendations Section__

Note that the section we want starts with `"II. Conclusions and/or recommendations\n"`. What function would you use to get everything *after* this substring? Fill in the blank below and assign the value to a new variable called `rec_text`.

```{r}
sections = str_split(text, "II. Conclusions and/or recommendations\n")[[1]]
rec_text = sections[2] # get second item -- everything after.
```

__1.3 Turn it into a vector__

Using a `stringr` function, turn the string above into a vector of lines, and store it in a variable called `recs`. Remember that a new line is represented by `\n`.

```{r}
recs <- str_split(rec_text, "\n")[[1]]
recs[1:5]
```

#### 2. Chunk Recomendations {-}

These texts have 3 sections each. 
1. The first section contains those recommendations the country supports. 
2. The second section contains recs the country will examine. 
3. The third contains recommendations the country explicitely rejects. 

**task**:

- parse recommendations into three piles, corresponding to accepted recs, examined recs, and rejected recs.
- combine these piles back into a dataframe, containing the text of the recommendation and its corresponding decision.
- add additional columns for `to` country and `year`.

__2.1: Find the paragraph numbers__

Each section starts with a main paragraph number (e.g. **127**). The individual recommendations are then noted as subparagraphs (e.g. **127.1, 127.2** etc.).

All the accepted recommendations have the same main paragraph number (**127**). Next come the recommendations which will be examined, whose main paragraph number is just the next integer (**128**). After that are the rejected recommendations, with the next integer as their main paragraph number (**129**).

We can't know the paragraph numbers beforehand, because each file is different. But we *can* leverage our knowledge of the structure of the documents to get them.

Fill in the blanks below to create 3 variables containing the 3 paragraph numbers.

```{r}
para1 = str_extract(recs[1], "\\d+")
para1 = as.numeric(para1)
para2 = para1 + 1
para3 = para2 + 1
```

__2.2 Parse the text__

Now create 3 new vectors: `accept_recs`, `examine_recs`, `reject_recs.` Each vector should contain the recommendations assigned to its corresponding section.

**hint**: How do you know if a line belongs to a section? It starts with the main paragraph number for that section. So use the **str_starts** function.

```{r}
# subset recommendations
accept_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para1))]
# accept_recs = str_subset(recs, str_c("^", as.character(para1)))
examine_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para2))]
reject_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para3))]

# remove the first item from each list, which just demarcates the sections
accept_recs = accept_recs[-1]
examine_recs = examine_recs[-1]
reject_recs = reject_recs[-1]
```

__2.3 Tranform to Dataframe__

The following code combines the three vectors back into a dataframe with two column: `text` (of the recommendation), and `decicion` (whether the recommendation was accepted, examined, or rejected)

```{r}
recs_df <- list(accept = accept_recs,
                    examine = examine_recs,
                    reject = reject_recs)

recs_df <- stack(recs_df) %>%
  select("text" = values, "decision" = ind)
```

Your job is to add 2 new columns to this dataframe: `to` should contain the country under review, and `year` should contain the year under review. Note that we already created these variables above, in question 1.1

```{r}
recs_df <- recs_df %>%
  mutate(to = country,
         year = year)

head(recs_df)
```

#### 3. Get Recommending Country {-}

**task**
- extract the substring representing the recommending country.
- add this information to our dataframe.

__3.1 Extract recommending country__

Take a look at several recommendation texts to get an idea of their format.

```{r}
head(recs_df$text)
```

Notice that they're all formatted the same way, with the recommending country in parenthesis at the end, in between parentheses.

Using your string skills, find a way to pull out the recommending country from the first recommendation (stored in `first_rec` below).

```{r}
first_rec = recs_df$text[1]
```

```{r}
rec_after_paran <- str_split(first_rec, "\\(")[[1]]
rec_after_paran <- tail(rec_after_paran, 1)
first_rec_country = str_split(rec_after_paran, "\\)")[[1]]
first_rec_country <- first_rec_country[1]

# this should be 'Philipines'.
first_rec_country
```

__3.2 Create a Function__

Create a function called `get_country` that passes an individual recommendation text and returns the recommending country.

```{r}
get_country <- function(rec){
  rec_after_paran <- str_split(rec, "\\(")[[1]]
  rec_after_paran <- tail(rec_after_paran, 1) # get last item
  first_rec_country = str_split(rec_after_paran, "\\)")[[1]]
  first_rec_country <- first_rec_country[1] # get first item
  
  return(first_rec_country)
}

# test your code
get_country(first_rec)
```

__3.3 Add `from` column__

Using your `map` and `dplyr` skills, add a column to `recs_df` that contains the country issuing each recommendation.

```{r}
recs_df <- recs_df %>% mutate(
  from = map_chr(text, get_country)
)
```

#### 4. Repeat for all documents {-}

We just wrote code that takes one document and turns it into a dataset!

The problem is we have 11 documents!

**task**

- combine the code we've written so far to create a function
- apply that function to all files to create a single dataset.

__4.1 Make a function__

Combine the functions that you wrote above to create a single function that passes a row number of `all_texts` (i.e. an integer), and returns a dataframe of fully parsed recommendations in that file.

```{r}
parse_file <- function(i){
    # get filename and text
    text <- all_texts$text[i]
    file_name <- all_texts$doc_id[i]
    
    # get to country and year
    country <- str_sub(file_name, 1, -9)
    year <-str_sub(file_name, -8, -5)
    
    # get vector of recs
    sections = str_split(text, "II. Conclusions and/or recommendations\n")[[1]]
    rec_text = sections[2] # get second item -- everything after.
    recs = str_split(rec_text, "\n")[[1]]
    
    # get paragraph numbers
    para1 = str_extract(recs[1], "\\d+")
    para1 = as.numeric(para1)
    para2 = para1 + 1
    para3 = para2 + 1
    
    # chunk recommendations
    accept_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para1))]
    examine_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para2))]
    reject_recs = recs[str_starts(recs, as.character(para3))]
    
    # remove the first item from each list, which just demarcates the sections
    accept_recs = accept_recs[-1]
    examine_recs = examine_recs[-1]
    reject_recs = reject_recs[-1]
    
    # transform to dataframe
    recs_df <- list(accept = accept_recs,
                        examine = examine_recs,
                        reject = reject_recs)
    
    recs_df <- stack(recs_df) %>%
      select("text" = values, "decision" = ind)
    
    recs_df <- recs_df %>%
      mutate(to = country,
             year = year)
    
    # add from column
    recs_df <- recs_df %>% mutate(
      from = map_chr(text, get_country)
    )
}
```

__4.2 Map the function__

Apply the function you created above to all rows in `all_texts` using your `map_` skills. The final output should contain a dataframe of all the recommendations from all the files.__

```{r}
all_recs <- map_dfr(1:nrow(all_texts), parse_file)
```

__4.3 Print Dimensions and Write a csv__

Print the dimensions and export the full dataframe into a csv.  You're done!

```{r eval = F}
dim(all_recs) # should be 1709 x 5
# write.csv(all_recs, "upr-recs.csv")
```
