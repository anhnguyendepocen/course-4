## R Packages

The best part about R are its user-contributed packages (also called "libraries"). A _library_ is a collection of functions (and sometimes data) that can be used by other programers. A library's contents are supposed to be related, but this isn't always the case as there is no enforcement on the issue.

### Installing Packages

Using packages requires two steps.

First, we download the package from one of the CRAN mirrors onto our computer. For this we use  `install.packages("package-name")`. If you have not set a preferred CRAN mirror in your `options()`, a menu will pop up asking you to choose a location. 

Let's download the package `dplyr`.

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

If you run into errors later in the course about a function or package not being found, run the `install.packages` function to make sure the package is actually installed. 

**Important**: Once we download the package, we never need to run `install.packages` again (unless we get a new computer.)

### Loading Packages

Once we download the package, we need to load it into our session to use it. This is required at the beginning of each R session. This step is necessary because if we automatically loaded every package we have ever downloaded, our computer would fry.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

The message tells you which functions from dplyr conflict with functions in base R (or from other packages you might have loaded).

### Challenges

Let's go ahead and download some core, important packages we'll use for the rest of the course. Download and load the following packages:

* tidyverse
* rmarkdown
* knitr
* gapminder
* devtools
